            <p>We took a look at many of the major airlines and comapred their values for in-flight
                incidents, fatal accidents, and fatalities. Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/airline-safety">FiveThirtyEight</a> for collecting this awesome data!</p>

        <p>I chose to represent my data as a bar chart for many reasons. When viewing a bar chart, the viewer judges
             position along a common scale. This allows the users to make quick generalizations about the data. For example it is clear
             to see that Delta/Northwest had the most in-flight incidents. If the viewer wants more detailed information about a certain
             line I added tooltips to give more detailed information. They repeat the name of the airline and the value that bar is representing.
             Due to the large number of airlines, the x-axis labels can be hard to read. To combat this issue I added the name of the airline to the
             tooltip.</p>
        <p>I allow the viewer to select between incidents, fatal accidents, and total fatalities. This will allow them to gain more insight into the data.
            If the user is viewing incidents and then switches to fatalities and sees a large discrepancy they can look further into that information. For example Malaysia Airlines
            doesn't seem to have very many incidents, but leads in regards to fatalities. If the viewer finds this interesting they can look further into that incident. The number
            of ticks on the yAxis changes dependant on the max of the data being shown. This helps the viewer understand the data.
        </p>
        <p>I chose to color this page purple. I thought this was a visually appealing color that conformed to modern color standards. I increased
            the opacity of the bars so that they also conformed to modern standards. I changed the tooltip color so that it fit with the chosen colors and
            is easy to read.
